# Cyberpunk 2077 save backuper

## Why
- Cyberpunk only has 10 quick save slots, which get overwritten quickly. This isn't usually an issue when playing solo, but after the expansion release, my girlfriend accidentally overwrote my saves twice while playing. Losing a dozen hours of progress was frustrating, and since learning manual saves felt less appealing than creating a backup script, I decided to write this simple script.

## How to use
- Place the `backuper.py` in the Cyberpunk saves folder.. For Windows the default path is typically `*:\Users\*\Saved Games\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077`.
- Run the script manually (not recommended) or schedule it with Windows `Task scheduler`. See https://www.jcchouinard.com/python-automation-using-task-scheduler/ or any other tutorial.
